# Welcome to Maria Beletsky's Assignment B4 Repo 

This repo contains an .Rmd file containing the source code for Maria Beletsky's 
Assignment B4 for STAT 545B (December 2024) and the knitted .md file. 

For Assignment B4, I chose Option A, and so in this assignment I plotted the most common
words in Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* and fitted a linear model to world population data
from the "gapminder" dataset from the "gapminder" R package. Please view the knitted .md file to
see the assignment. 

The "assignment-b4-mbeletsky_files/figure-gfm" folder contains images of the plots generated in this assignment.
